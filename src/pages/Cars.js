        <p>
            Horacio Paganiâ€™s company is now in its third decade, and here is its third creation. The C8 project, the Zonda, began to establish the legend.<br />
            The C9 project, the Huayra, built upon this on a global scale, integrating the use of active aerodynamics and Carbo-Titanium. <br />
            What then, could its third model, codenamed C10, add? More power, increased performance, a better structure and aerodynamics? <br />
            Absolutely, but what else? Above all, you need a goal.</p>
