        <p>"Princess just wants a new car.<br />
            I have told her that hers will go far.<br />
            'Oh, it's really not cool<br />
            driving this crap to school.'<br />
            'Do I need that emotional scar? '
        </p>
        <p>
            'The kids will all laugh at the rust.<br />
            When we race, I'll be left in the dust!<br />
            I will save up some cash<br />
            then we'll make a mad dash<br />
            to the car dealer surely you trust'.<br />
        </p>
        <p>
            'He will make us a wonderful deal<br />
            and I'm sure you will know how I feel.<br />
            I will love you so much,<br />
            My siblings... I won't touch.<br />
            Just get me behind a new wheel'!
        </p>
        <p>
            Now she'll be cruisin in style.<br />
            She'll be happy for only awhile.<br />
            There will always be better<br />
            and we'll try hard to get her<br />
            a car that will make princess smile."<br />
